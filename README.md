# Draft: effect of fire on vegetation

## Goal

Our main goal is to understand the impact of fire on vegetation cover from the perspective of protected species and areas. We analyzed data of endangered plant species and conservation units in the Legal Amazon in order to address the following questions:

1. what is the impact of fire on the distribution of endangered plant species
2. are less restriced conservation units being more affected by fire?

## Methods

### Data 

1. Fire data

We analyzed data from NASA collected by the MODIS satallite between 2001 and 2019 (08/24/2019). We only included fire spots with confidence > 80 and inside Legal Amazon.

2. Endangered species data

We used data generated by CNC Flora from the portaria 443/2014. From all XXXX species, 127 are inside Legal Amazon area, being 9 critically endangered, 26 endangered and 30 vulnerable to extinction.


3. Conservation Units data

### Statistical analysis

1 % of species records affected by fire

2. Frequency of fire on conservation units of different types
